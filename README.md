## About Sudoku 

Sudoku is a Japanese puzzle game. It means “Single Number” or “Number Place”. The game consists of a 9x9 grid, which is divided into nine 3x3 grids (called boxes or sub-grids).  When the game begins, a player will be provided with random numbers in random cells. The objective is to fill the empty cells with a number from 1 to 9 in the shortest time. To
complete the Sudoku puzzle, each cell must be filled such that

1. Each number must only occur in a column once.
2. Each number must only occur in a row once.
3. Each number must occur in a sub-grid only once.
